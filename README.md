# Pudding

It's where the design proof is

A GitHub Pages site that hosts every dated static build of a project and serves them
one at a time, with a generated index linking to each.

## Adding a build

1. Drop the build's folder into `builds/`, named `YYYY-MM-DD`. It must contain an
   `index.html`, and its asset paths must be relative (no leading `/`), since the site
   is served from a subpath.
2. Commit and push.

The index regenerates on push — the list is read from the folder names in `builds/`,
never hand-written. To preview locally first:

```bash
node scripts/generate-index.mjs && python3 -m http.server 4321
```

## Editing the copy

Project name, author, and description live in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "It is as if you were doing work",
  "author": "Pippin Barr",
  "description": "..."
}
```

`name` and `author` are required; `description` is optional, and its paragraph is
omitted when absent or empty.

## How it deploys

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs `scripts/generate-index.mjs` and publishes the
repository to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. This requires
**Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"**.

`index.html` is generated output — edit `scripts/generate-index.mjs`, not the HTML.

## Known quirk

The `2016-12-28` build references a `css/style.css` that isn't present in that
snapshot, so it renders unstyled. That's how the build was archived; it hasn't been
patched, to keep the snapshots faithful.
